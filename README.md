# Failed-ANN-on-Rosenbrock-s-Function
This is a section where simple ANN algorithm with all type of activation functions were failed. While running prediction on a simple function mainly called as Rosenbrock function because of its steepness.
# Modified ANN with a log function
This is a section where the same function was modified with a log fucntion allowing to show the convergence of loss functions.
